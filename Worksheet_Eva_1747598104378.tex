\section*{Guided Notes and Worked Examples}

\subsection*{Limiting and Excess Reagents}
\textbf{Definition:} The limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction, determining the maximum amount of product that can be formed. The excess reagent is the reactant that remains after the reaction is complete.

\textbf{Example:} In the reaction of 2H\(_2\) + O\(_2\) ? 2H\(_2\)O, if you start with 4 moles of H\(_2\) and 1 mole of O\(_2\):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Step 1: Moles of each reactant:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item H\(_2\): 4 moles  
        \item O\(_2\): 1 mole  
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Step 2: Stoichiometric ratios:}  
    From the balanced equation, 2 moles of H\(_2\) react with 1 mole of O\(_2\).
    
    \item \textbf{Step 3: Determine the limiting reagent:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Calculation:} To react completely with 4 moles of H\(_2\), we need \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) moles of O\(_2\). Since we only have 1 mole of O\(_2\), it is the limiting reagent.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Step 4: Maximum product formation:}
    Each mole of O\(_2\) produces 2 moles of H\(_2\)O. Therefore, with 1 mole of O\(_2\), a maximum of 2 moles of H\(_2\)O can be produced.
    
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Conclusion:} O\(_2\) is the limiting reagent, and we can produce 2 moles of water (H\(_2\)O) from the given amounts of reactants.

\subsection*{Percent Yield}
\textbf{Definition:} Percent yield is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction, calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \right) \times 100
\]
\textbf{Example:} If the theoretical yield of a reaction is 50g and the actual yield is 40g, the percent yield is:  
\[
\text{Percent Yield} = \left( \frac{40g}{50g} \right) \times 100 = 80\%
\]

\subsection*{Empirical Formula vs. Molecular Formula}
\textbf{Definitions:} 
- The empirical formula is the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound.
- The molecular formula shows the actual number of each type of atom in a molecule.

\textbf{Example:} A compound contains 40\% carbon, 6.7\% hydrogen, and 53.3\% oxygen by mass.  
1. Convert to moles:
   - Moles of C = \( \frac{40g}{12g/mol} \approx 3.33 \) moles  
   - Moles of H = \( \frac{6.7g}{1g/mol} = 6.7 \) moles  
   - Moles of O = \( \frac{53.3g}{16g/mol} \approx 3.33 \) moles  
2. Find the simplest ratio:
   - Divide by the smallest number of moles (3.33): C: 1, H: 2, O: 1
3. Empirical formula = CH\(_2\)O.  
4. If the molar mass of the compound is 180 g/mol, find the molecular formula:
   - Molar mass of empirical formula (CH\(_2\)O) = 30 g/mol.  
   - Ratio = \( \frac{180g/mol}{30g/mol} = 6 \).  
   - Molecular formula = C\(_6\)H\(_{12}\)O\(_6\).

\section*{Practice Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Given the reaction: 3Fe + 4H\(_2\)O ? Fe\(_3\)O\(_4\) + 4H\(_2\). If you have 5 moles of Fe and 6 moles of H\(_2\)O, identify the limiting reagent and calculate the amount of Fe\(_3\)O\(_4\) produced.
    
    \item A reaction yields 15.0g of product when the theoretical yield is 20.0g. Calculate the percent yield.
    
    \item A compound is composed of 20\% nitrogen and 80\% oxygen by mass. Determine the empirical formula.
    
    \item If the molar mass of the compound from Problem C is determined to be 92 g/mol, what is the molecular formula?
    
    \item In a chemical reaction, 25g of reactant A reacts with 30g of reactant B. If the limiting reagent is A and the theoretical yield is 40g, what is the percent yield if the actual yield is 28g?
    
    \item A compound has an empirical formula of CH\(_2\) and a molar mass of 70 g/mol. What is its molecular formula?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Answer Key}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Limiting reagent: H\(_2\)O (4 moles Fe would require 6 moles H\(_2\)O).
    - Fe\(_3\)O\(_4\) produced: 1.67 moles (calculated from stoichiometry: 4 moles H\(_2\)O produce 1 mole Fe\(_3\)O\(_4\)).
    
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Percent yield: 75\% (calculated as \( \frac{15.0g}{20.0g} \times 100 \)).
    
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Empirical formula: NO\(_2\) (20g N = 0.714 moles, 80g O = 5 moles; simplest ratio is 1:2).
    
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Molecular formula: N\(_2\)O\(_4\) (molecular weight 92g/mol is 4 times empirical weight of NO\(_2\)).
    
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Percent yield: 70\% (calculated as \( \frac{28g}{40g} \times 100 \)).
    
    \item \textbf{Solution:} 
    - Molecular formula: C\(_5\)H\(_{10}\) (molar mass 70g/mol is 5 times empirical weight of CH\(_2\)).

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Visual Aids:** Suggested including a diagram or flowchart to illustrate the concept; however, I did not include an actual image due to the text nature of this platform.
2. **Simplified Examples:** Used simpler numbers and relatable contexts while ensuring clarity.
3. **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Added structured steps for problem-solving in each example and problem.
4. **Detailed Explanations in the Answer Key:** Each solution includes a brief explanation of the calculation process and reasoning behind the answers.
5. **Real-World Applications:** While not explicitly shown in the text, the problems can be related to real-life applications in the context of food and pharmaceutical production, which could be discussed in class.

This revision aims to improve clarity, engagement, and educational value for Grade 10 Honors students.
